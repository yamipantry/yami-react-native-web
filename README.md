# Cooking Made Easy

One of the hardest things about cooking is figuring out what to eat. Yami Pantry aims at making this process easier. Just add items to your pantry and our smart algorithm gives you a list of recipes. Cooking has never been easier.

# Making Cooking Social Again

Once you have finished choosing the recipe why not invite your friends or neighbors with a Yami Dinner. Yami Dinners creates a marker in the location you are hosting the Yami Dinner. People in your area can then view the recipe and a description. After that they can send you a message and you and friends can coordinate what time to show up or what to bring.
